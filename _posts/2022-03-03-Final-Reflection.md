It's now been over three weeks since I finished my exchange studies in Delft,
and it's time for me to do a proper reflection of my experience. The format that
I've chosen for this is to first give a short summary of the entire
experience, and then answer some miscellaneous questions that might be interesting
for the reader. Finally, I'll post some of my favorite photos that captures
my time in Delft. Grab yourself a cup of coffee and enjoy!

# Summary
Ever since I started studying toward a Bachelor's in Computer Science & Computer Engineering,
I wanted to go for exchange studies. I applied during my first year, but it turned
out that I was required to have more experience before going abroad (which
was frustrating at the time, but I think also very reasonable). During my second
year I applied again, and I chose TU Delft as my first choice. Why Delft you may ask? Well, it's one of the "better" universities
that my home university has partnered with, they had interesting courses,
and due to covid, it felt like a good idea to stay within Europe.
This time I got accepted and even though application
process was long, after about 8-9 months from first applying I knew for sure that I would be going.

Fast forward a bit, and on the 26th of August 2021 I first arrived in Delft
to start my Erasmus exchange studies.
I hadn't mentally prepared very much for moving abroad for a half a year, and
I remember how much it shocked me when I first arrived. Everything would be
completely different for the next 4-5 months, which includes: long-distance
relationship with my girlfriend and family, living in a country whose language
I don't speak, and knowing absolutely no one. This was a lot for me to digest,
and took some time to get used to. Also, during the first two and a half weeks,
I would be sharing a house together with a few other people. After that, I would
get my keys to an apartment that I was going to sublease from a Dutch student
who was also going abroad for exchange studies. Living together with other people
was completely new for me (not including family) and for a person who is very fond
of his privacy, it was definitely a challenge.

Regardless, life goes and you get used to things, and while I was getting used
to the idea of living abroad, I was very excited to start my studies!
My idea was to take a minor, in **Electronics for Robotics**,
which contained a package of courses that were all related to Electrical Engineering.
Because there was such a broad variety of courses to choose from, I also took
a course in **Machine Learning for Robotics**, which was a Master's course.
In total, the courses were worth 35 credits, and while a normal semester is
only 30 credits, I was quite confident that it would be no problem.
However, I have to admit, that it was definitely more work, and harder that I
had anticipated. The reason for this was that the work-load per credit was
higher that at my home university, and for some of the courses, I did not
really have enough theoretical knowledge, so it became very hard to follow
the content. Further, I hadn't studied what courses were included in the minor in great detail,
which backfired a bit, because I found some of the courses less
interesting and not particularly useful for me. While I could have dropped some
of the courses, to me that was no really even an option, since I was determined to finish
what I had started. Dropping courses because the work-load is too high is not really my thing,
Either way, a part from university courses
I also signed up for a Digital Photography course, and got myself a gym membership.

While I was trying to spend as much time as possible to study and follow my courses,
I also wanted to explore the city of Delft, as well as the Netherlands in general, get to know some new people, and have some fun.
Because of this, the first quarter become pretty stressful and I did my best to
balance the activities while trying to stay sane and enjoy my time abroad.
At the end of the first quarter, I had 5 exams in 7 days (nothing I'd recommend), and this hit me quite
hard. Something that I looked forward to during this hectic time, was that on the day of the
last exam, my girlfriend came to visit me, and I took a well-deserved half-week completely
off from studies. This was very well needed! ðŸ˜ƒ

During the second quarter the work-load in school was significantly less, which
was very nice and I enjoyed some extra time to relax, and focus on myself a bit more.
Roughly once every two or three weeks, I had visitors from home, which was a nice way for me to
explore the city a bit more, eat at some good restaurants, find some nice bars,
and keep connection with my family.

As usual during the autumn, time went fast and eventually Christmas was coming up. At the 21:st of
December, I flew home for Christmas break. At this point I hadn't left Delft since I arrived,
about 4 months earlier. I remember that it felt very weird to come home again,
and I noticed how much *"at home"* I had started to feel in Delft. However, it was very nice to come home again,
and to celebrate the Christmas with my family. We even got a white Christmas,
which is pretty rare for where I live in Sweden!

I was in Sweden almost 4 weeks and came back to Delft on the 17th of January,
in order to write my two, final exams. At this point I realized that I wasn't
as prepared as I usually am, so I had to spend pretty much all time awake to study
for the exams, and 10 days later it was over; I had officially written my last
exam of the exchange! During this last week, I also tried to do some reflection
and take some final walks around the city of Delft. I cleaned the apartment,
packed my bags, and on the 28th of January 2022, I flew home to Sweden again.
My exchange studies at TU Delft was now officially over.

This was a quite fast summary of my experience, but if you'd like to read it in
more detail, feel free to follow the entire journey, starting from my
[first post]({% post_url 2021-07-29-First post %}) of the blog ðŸ˜ƒ.

If you're any curious to how the exams went, I passed all courses with a grade
between 8 and 9.5 out of 10. This felt really good and I'm very proud with how it went.

# Q/A
Here's answers to some questions that might be interesting!

## What was the best thing(s) about the exchange?
- I loved the city of Delft, the canals, the narrow streets, the restaurants, the bars and the atmosphere.
- I felt very free. I was alone, in a different country, far away from home, and I could do (in theory) whatever I wanted to do. While I didn't do any crazy stuff, this was a very nice feeling. Of course, the downside is the feeling of loneliness, so there's an important balance to keep.
- I took a photography course which I really loved. The teacher was very special, and inspiring and I feel like I've learnt techniques that I'll keep with me forever. What I like about it is not that I'm now a very good photographer, but rather more inspired.
- Exploring a new city and a completely new country was very exciting. I love to travel, so in some ways, the exchange was one very long travelling adventure!

## What was the worst thing(s) about the exchange?
- Being far away from my partner and my family was definitely the hardest part of the exchange. Like everything, you get used to it, but unfortunately that doesn't make it suck any less.

## What did you learn from the exchange?
From a technical perspective, I've learnt:
- A lot more about electronics, which includes both the physics of it (eg Maxwell's equations, EM radiation),
as well as the circuit analysis of it. I feel way more comfortable with the fundamental concepts of electronics
such as voltage dividers, amplifiers etc. However, all this knowledge is mainly theoretical
so I feel like I'd like to get more practical experience as well. Here's where side projects comes in!
- The fundamentals of Fourier analysis, which I discussed briefly in an [earlier post]({% post_url 2021-09-30-Introduction-to-Digital-Signal-Processing %}).
I feel like this knowledge is very useful because it describes beautiful relationships between time and frequency, and comes up
in many topics of Electrical Engineering.
- The fundamentals of Machine Learning, which is also a good skill to have in your toolbelt. I'm not as hyped as most people are about this though, so
while I'm very glad that I've (briefly) covered some of the topics of the field, I don't have any desires to explore it in more depth as of right now.

But of course, I've also learnt a lot more than just the technical stuff from school!
- I've realized that you get use to things, regardless of the circumstances. This might sound obvious, but
I think it can be helpful to truly consider and appreciate this. During my initial time in Delft, I felt a bit lost,
confused and wasn't sure if I had done a good or bad thing. But, as time passed, I eventually got used to being
by myself, in a different country, and I remember that before going home for Christmas, I really felt at home in Delft.
I remember thinking that this was pretty cool and the only thing that I missed was my partner and my family. If they
had all moved to Delft, I think most things would be as normal.
- I've found where some of my bigger priorities in life are. I think it's important to do something exciting and important in life,
so what I do for a living in the future should matter. However, during the exchange I have also come to the realization that for me,
life is more than just work, or studies. To me, life is also about hanging out with other people, whether it's your family
or friend I don't think really matters. To me, life is about exploring new places, and trying out new
foods and new drinks. To me, life should be a combination of doing something useful (eg during your job), but
also doing something that you enjoy and gives you enough reasons to wake up everyday, excited.


## Restaurant tips in Delft?
Hmm, here's a few:
- *Le Vieux Jean* is a fancier one, which is really nice.
- *De Centrale* is another fancier one which is also very good.
- *Bierfabriek Delft* is a pretty relaxed and cool place. You get free (whole) peanuts and you can throw the shells on the floor. Awesome.
- *CafÃ© de Wijnhaven*. They had vegan dÃ¶nerkebab which was really good ðŸ˜ƒ.
- *CafÃ© Het Klooster* is very cozy a bar, but has tons of nice beer.

## Would you do another exchange if you got the chance to?
I'm at the end of my bachelor's degree, and at the moment do not plan to continue
studying, so there's not really room for it. However, if I were to take a master's
degree, I might! If I had not gone, and was asked to go I would definitely do it!

## What would you do differently if you did the exchange again?
1. I would ensure that the courses that I'm registered for are *all* at least a bit interesting, especially
when taking a minor. I was mainly attracted by **1** of the courses in my minor, which
wasn't as cool as I had anticipated, so be sure that you spend enough time on picking courses.
2. Don't take as many courses, and instead take the time to enjoy living abroad instead. ðŸ˜ƒ

## Was it expensive to live in Delft?
Not really, most things was was about the same as home (Sweden), including food,
clothes etc. Beer was definitely cheaper though, which was a nice bonus! They had
tons of good beer in Delft.

## Was it difficult to live in a country whose language you didn't understand?
Not at all, everyone whom I spoke to knew at least a little bit of English.
Initially I was planning to take some course in Dutch, but then changed my mind
when I had heard it a few days. I'm so sorry to say it, but Dutch isn't the
most beautiful language... Sorry Dutch people!

## How did you get your accommodation?
I actually found it through a Facebook page. I was also registered at a few different
sites, and looked for accommodation for about 3-4 weeks before I found this one.
TU Delft did offer automatic accommodation
service, for a fee of ~250 euros, but at the time of the offer, I hadn't decided to
go for the exchange yet, due to covid. I was lucky to find another student whom
I could sublease the apartment from.

## Does it require much work to apply for exchange studies?
It depends on how many different universities that you consider applying for.
At my uni, we can apply for multiple universities, all given a certain priority,
so if there's only 1 school that you consider, then it's less work. What you have
to do is to find out what courses are available for you to take. While this may
sound quite trivial, it can be significantly more difficult that you'd might expect.
The reason for this is that some universities has poor websites and/or outdated course
catalogs. You also must ensure that the courses are in the correct semester, give
you enough credits, and that you can take them into account for your home university.
I think it's worth spending the proper amount of time during the planning phase
even if it's boring, because the more work you do beforehand, the less surprises
you'll get when you finally go.

## Final tips for someone considering to go for exchange?
DO IT!

That's it, I hope you've enjoyed the blog, and learned something new, or at least got
inspired to do so. I've had such a good time and I am very grateful for being
given the opportunity to do the exchange. I feel like I've grown as a person
and gotten to know myself better and what my priorities in life are.

I'll end with a quote from myself:

"*If you're ever feeling down, then you should go to Delft, buy a stroopwaffel, buy a coffee, and a beer, and realize that life is actually pretty good sometimes.*" - Victor Krook
