Hey!
It's already been 3 weeks since I arrived in Delft now and time is starting to
speed up. Last Friday I got access to my new apartment, which is located on
the campus area. It's a 29$$m^2$$ studio with my own kitchen and bathroom
that I sublease. I moved all my stuff (not really that much) on Saturday morning
and it took some time to pack up and get everything in place. I realized that I wanted
to get some stuff from ikea, so on Sunday I went to there. It's
actually really close, like 10 minutes with bike so that was very nice.
I found some decorations and a lamp etc to make the place feel more
like home. üè†

So from now on, I will live in this apartment until the end of January and I
have to say that it is **so** good to have my own place. Even though the house
that I shared before was nice and all, I value my privacy high, so it's
not even comparable to having my own place.

I also went to a nice caf√© on Sunday, [coffeecompany](https://coffeecompany.nl/),
where I had a nice cup of coffee and did some studying. It was a very cozy place
with canales running just next to it. I took some photos, but unfortunately, they were all
quite bad actually, the focus was really off, so I have to get back some time
to take better ones! üì∑

This leads me to this weeks photo challenge, which was to shoot with a long shutter speed and try to catch
some motion, while keeping the image sharp (on the places it should be sharp).
I did some experimenting with shooting in complete darkness and then using a flashlight
to *"paint"* towards the camera. This effect was actually really cool and after
several attempts I managed to get a photo like this:

I also wanted to capture motion in other ways, so I headed out to *oostpoort*
here in Delft and tried to photograph some of the cyclists during the night.

I also bought a new lens for my camera, a [50mm f/1.8](https://www.cameranu.nl/p615075/yongnuo-ef-yn-50mm-f-1-8-objectief-canon-ef-vatting)
which I think I will be able to take some really cool photos with. The
main difference between this and my current zoom lens, is (I think) that this new lense
can get a much crispier and lower depth of focus which allows me to shoot
at higher shutter speeds (faster). I will have to do some experimentation with this!

School-wise everything is going pretty well.
I had my first lecture in the fifth course (Electronics Circuits) last Friday and I really like the
lecturer. The course seems to focus more on the broader perspective and not too
much on the details, which is a nice difference, compared to the other courses.
One of the first sentances the lecturer said was:

*"A model is only a model, if you know a model, you don't know the world"*

Which I felt like I just had to quote, because it feels very powerful. While
he was talking about it from a technical perspective (circuits), I think it
can be interpreted and applied to any field. Feel free to switch out the word
*model* and you can completely change the meaning of the quote.

So now I take 5 courses simultaneously
and 3 of them require quite a lot of work, so I have things to do pretty much
all the time. The hardest course at the moment is Digital Communication Systems
where we tend to focus more (too much in my opinion) on mathematical formulas and derivations
than the actual concepts. It also expects you to have more math background than I do,
which makes it even more tough. Oh well, not too much to do, I just have to work harder!

I will probably do some more technical posts in the future, where I will try to
explain some of the topics that I've learned or that I'm currently learning.
I will probably start with fourier analysis, so I hope you're excited about that!
