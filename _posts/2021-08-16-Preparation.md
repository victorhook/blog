Today it's less than two weeks until I leave. I will fly to Amsterdam on
the 26th of August and from there, take the train to Delft.
On Friday 27th, we will have our introduction to the Minor and then the courses
starts the week after that.

The first two and a half weeks I will live together with another person, which
I have booked through airbnb. This will be very interesting since I've never
lived like that before. The place is pretty close to campus which is nice!

After these weeks, I will sublease an apartment for the remainder of my time.
This apartment is 29 m2 and also very close to the campus.

The courses that i will take are:
- Circuit Analysis
- Marsrover project
- Advanced Electronics for Robotics
- Electronic Circuits
- Digital Communication Systems
- Guided and Wireless EM Transfer
- Signal Processing

I'm very excited about **Marsrover project**, which I think will be very fun
and cool! ðŸ˜Ž
