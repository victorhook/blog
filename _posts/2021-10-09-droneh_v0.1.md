Hey! Another week has passed here in Delft üòé
My girlfriend visited me during the
weekend. It had been over 5 weeks since we last met so it was super nice to
see each other again. We walked around the city a bit and went to the Hague, but
mostly just relaxed and hung out. 5 weeks is quite a long time, even though it
has been going both slow and fast at the same time. She left on Monday and once
we'd said goodbye it was back to school again!

I got my midterm result back and it went well (27/27 actually), great success! üòÉ

I really miss tinkering with electronics and doing my maker-projects, so I've started
a new long-term project which I will work on whenever I have some time leftover.
I've wanted to build my own drone for a long time, and last summer
[I assembled my own FPV drone](https://mrhookv.com/projects/FPV%20Drone), which
was actually the most fun project I've ever done. However, my original goal was
to build a drone from scratch, and **not** use pre-programmed parts that handles
everything for you (which the FPV drone did). Now I feel like it's time for this and I've therefor started
my new long-term project: **droneh**.

## droneh
This is going to be a small drone, inspired by the [crazyflie](https://www.bitcraze.io/products/old-products/crazyflie-2-0/)
architecture. The main objectives with the project is to learn more about:
- UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle)
- Drone mechanics
- Circuit design
- Embedded programming

I know that getting a drone to fly is actually a lot harder than one might think
but I feel confident that I will succeed. It might take a few iterations, but I know
that it will work eventually üòé So far I've only made a rough plan and a schematic of all
the parts that I will need:

####  Architecture
The idea is that the drone will consist of the following (main) components:
- [Raspberry pi pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/) - Flight controller.
- [nRF24L01](https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/SMD/nRF24L01Pluss_Preliminary_Product_Specification_v1_0.pdf) - Radio communication.
- [MPU-6050](https://invensense.tdk.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MPU-6000-Datasheet1.pdf) - 3-axis accelerometer and 3-axis gyroscope, used to measure acceleration and rotation.
- [VL53L1X](https://www.st.com/en/imaging-and-photonics-solutions/vl53l1x.html) - ToF laser-ranging sensor, used to measure height.
- [BMP180](https://nl.mouser.com/datasheet/2/783/BST-BMP180-DS000-1509579.pdf) - Barometer, to measure height.

During the first iteration, all of the components will be purchased as indivudal boards
and soldered onto a pcb. Honestly I don't know how well this will work (if it will work at all),
but it's definitely the easiest way to create a PoC (Proof of Concept). Further,
I will try to use brushed dc motors that will be controlled with an n-FET and pwm
signals. I think this will work (it works on the crazyflie...) but the key is
probably going to be to have the drone as light as possible. It will operate from
a single 1s lipo battery at ~3.7V.

With these components the drone should be able to estimate body velocity, attitude and position (at least height)
decently well. The idea is to make a controller as well, with two joysticks, which
I can use to fly the drone. However, with the help of the sensors above, the drone
should have enough features to be fully self-controlled and able to fly pre-planned
trajectories by itself. This is obviously not going to happen for a long time, but
it would be a cool end-goal. I won't go into too much details yet, since everything
is still very early and just in planning phase.

If you're feeling confused about some of the terms, don't you worry! When I feel
more comfortable with the drone mechanics, I'll dedicate a post to explain everything
you need to know to get a drone to fly! üòÉ

The image below is a preview of how the pcb looks right now. I will need to make some tweaks
and modifications to it, but overall I think it's in a good state.

#### First goal
The first goal is to get the drone to fly. üõ©Ô∏è See you next week!
