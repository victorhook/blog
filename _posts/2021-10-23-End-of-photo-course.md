All things eventually comes to an end, and so is the case for the photography
course that I've been taking at [X](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/x).
It's a bit sad that it's already over, but it has been very fun and I feel like I've learned quite a lot during the 7 weeks.
Our teacher was [Pieter Lemmens](https://www.lemmensphoto.com/) who comes from
the Hague (Netherlands) and has been doing photography all his life. He's a super
nice guy and very easy to get along and chat with.

I would like to explain some of the key concepts of photography that I've learned.
Note that some of the information might not be 100% accurate (I hope it is though)
so if you doubt something, please check it up yourself ðŸ˜ƒ

## Shutter speed
Shutter speed is how fast your sensor is exposed to light, or *how long your lens is open*.
This means that the *longer* time the lens is open, the more light hits the lens.
Likewise, the shorter time that the lens is open, less light is hitting the lense. This should be very intuitive.
By adjusting the speed of how fast the lense is opened and closed, we can control
how long this exposure is. Thus, the higher shutter-speed, the lower time
the sensor is exposed to light, and vice versa.

Another interesting impact of shutter speed is that if the lens is open during
a longer time period, objects that move tends to *blur*, or might even disappear entirely.
If the lens is open during a shorter time period, we can instead *freeze* objects,
that are moving very fast.

It's important to not confuse the time that the lense is open with the value of the shutter speed.
The relationship between the time and speed is $$time = \frac{1}{shutter\;speed}$$,
so the *higher* value of your shutter-speed, the *shorter* time the lens is open.
The image below tries to illustrate this concept.

| Shutter speed| Incoming light | Can freeze objects |
|---|---|
| High | Low | Yes |
| Low | High | No |


## Aperture
Aperture is *how much* of your lense that is exposed when taking a photo.
The more of your lense that is exposed, the more light falls
at the sensor (duh). The value of aperture also has an inverse relationship
with the how much of the lense that is exposed: $$\frac{1}{aperture \; value}$$.

The *higher* aperture value, the less your *lense* will open, and vice versa.

{% include image.html url="delft_25_aperture.svg" width="60%" description="Different aperture values."%}

With the aperture, we can also choose how deep our depth of focus will be.
This can be very handy and something cool to experiment with. The *lower*
the aperture, the smaller depth of focus, and vice versa.

| Aperture | Incoming light | Depth of focus |
|---|---|
| High | Low | Big |
| Low | High | Small |

## ISO
Iso makes your images brighter. The higher the ISO, the brighter the photo.
We usually want to have the ISO at its lowest value, because ISO comes with
the cost of added noise to the image. So, you typically only increase ISO
if you can't get more light in any other way.

## Raw vs JPG
When shooting images with a digital camera, we have several options of how we want our camera to store the images to the SD card.
The camera can either store them as *RAW*, *JPG*, or RAW *and* JPG.

So what is RAW and what is JPG?
- **JPG** is a compression type for images, and it can reduce the file-size *significantly*. However, it does so at a cost, because it's not a loseless compression algorithm. Some information from the original image is lost when it's converted to JPG. This can obviously be very bad, because sometimes we might want all the data from the image.
- **RAW** is just what it says. It's the RAW data that is required to describe the image. So from the light that hits the camera sensor, these voltage levels are somehow converted into discrete bits, which then represents *a snapshot of the world*, during the time the photo was taken. The RAW algorithm is different for most cameras, so it's not a set standard.
The advantage with RAW is that all information is kept and the biggest downside of this
is that RAW images take a lot of space (~25MB/photo)

So... what to pick?

The first thing our teacher told us was to always shoot in RAW *AND* JPG.
Having the RAW images can be a good idea, because there's certain things that
the camera does for you automatically when it's saving the images to JPG. And once
these settings are in the JPG, there's no way back to the original image. You
can obviously do a lot in photoshop etc, but you can never go back exactly, and
this could become an issue. However, with the RAW images, you can change certain
settings in photoshop that you can't with JPGs. Pretty cool!

If you're just shooting and don't really care too much then I think JPG is just
fine, because it takes way less space. However, space is not really an issue these days,
so I think that shooting in RAW and JPG is actually a very good idea.


## Light balance
The light balance allows us to change how different colors are treated by the camera.
By playing around with some of the settings, you can see very noticable effects
on your images. The value of the light balance is important if you're shooting
with jpg only, but it doesn't impact the raw images. We can actually change the
light balance in a raw image later if we want to (a benefit of keeping your RAWs').

For instance, by choosing the light balance *Daylight*, the images tend to
be more color-ish, so if I were to shoot a tree, the image would be more green,
or if I were to shoot the sky, it would be more blue. This is quite an un-technincal explanation but I think it's nice to just play around with some
of these settings!

## Focus
To make our photos appear crispy, we need to learn how to focus!
Step *one* is to use manual focus as much as possible, since this allows
full control. By manually adjusting the focus we can decide exactly what parts
of the image that should be in focus, and thus what part of the image we want
to have most attention. If we used auto-focus, it might do things that we don't want, and focus on some other parts that we're not interested of.

Also, auto-focus takes some time, so once you get use to manual focus, it's probably a bit faster. An obvious downside with manual focus is that it takes some practice to get used to! Initially, I thought it was very hard to focus manually (and still do), but it's getting better the more I do it.

## Lighting

{% include image.html url="delft_27_light.svg"%}

I think this image says it all...

Jokes aside, light is obviously very important in photography (definitely *the* most important factor), and should always be taken into account when taking photos. Sometimes, the light conditions are
so bad that you really can't even take a good photo. Other times, you will have
to do some trade-offs between some of the settings, to ensure you get the right light
in the photo.


You will always have a constant battle and trade-off between your shutter-speed
and your aperture. These two settings are the main ways in which you can control
how much light your image will have. By increasing one, you have to increase the other
one and vice versa.

How much light that hits your sensor is often measured in **stops**, where
*one stop is a a doubling or halving of light*. This comes in handy and makes
it an easy and convenient way to express how much you should adjust your settings.

## Portrait
When doing portaits, you should *always* (kind of) get focus on the eyes of the
person you're shooting. This makes really nice images!

That's it for the photography lesson. I hope that I didn't tell too many lies,
and perhaps that you learned something or at least got inspired to do so ðŸ“¸

As usual, I'll end the post with some photos!
