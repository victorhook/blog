The exam period is finally over and I'm pleased with how it went! I'm still
waiting for the results of two of them, but I think they went well.
Either way, new courses has started and that's nice!
Like I mentioned last week, from now on, I'll take (only) 3 courses:

- **Guided & Wireless EM Transfer** - So far it covers a lot of math and physics.
We've started with Maxwells' equations, so I had to brush up my vector calculus again
to be able to follow along. I hope this course covers more than just theoretical calculations
but so far it doesn't look like that. üòÜ
- **Advanced Electronics for Robotics** - Is divided in two parts:
  1. **Systematic Design** - How to properly design circuits (I guess?)
  2. **Power Electronics** - More practical approach to electronics that can be used
in robotics. I think this part will be more fun.
- **Mars Rover project** - Unfortunately, really not as exciting as I had expected.
The rover is already assembled and quite lame in my opinion. All it has to do is
follow a line (black tape) on a track. It's controlled with an fpga, so I had to brush up my
VHDL. The course is divided into 14 chapters, where chapters 1-8 implements the
functionality mentioned above (follow a line) and 9-14 extends this functionality
with other stuff. I don't really see why programming an fpga for a robot, I don't think
this is very realistic since you would probably use a finished MCU for this.
I think it would be more fun if we did this and used (or implemented) an RTOS (Real Time Operating System)
to perform multiple tasks simultaneously to control the robot. It's only been a week so I'm not going to complain too
much about the course but it is *the* reason I chose this Minor so you might imagine
why I'm (so far) a bit disappointed.

After the final exam last week, my girlfriend came to visit me, and it was very nice to see each other
again, relax and just hang out. We had food at many good restaurants and in general, had a really good time!
It was so nice to drop school for a bit and focus on other things.
During the last few weeks I've spent pretty much all my time on  studying, so during
this quarter I will not spend as much time on school, but instead do other stuff!

For instance, I want to tinker again! And continue working on my [drone project]({% post_url 2021-10-09-droneh_v0.1 %})
(I might have ordered [a 3D-printer](https://www.bol.com/nl/nl/p/3dandprint-3d-printer-x1-bouwpakket-fdm-printtechnologie-pla/9200000130935184/?Referrer=ADVNLGOO002013-G-123000383400-S-1074237037886-9200000130935184&gclid=Cj0KCQiA4b2MBhD2ARIsAIrcB-SQmR7MvVe9KwHfIRh8yvB5hAPLvXf2-ZabdOykCg_QLDbkFl4TEjIaAgLIEALw_wcB) (my third...ü§î)).
Also, I've signed up for a drawing course at X, which is going to be superfun.

That's it for this week, as usual, I'll end the post with a few photos üì∑
