Exam week is now officially over for me, and the first exam;
in **Advanced Electronics for Robotics** went well and the second one; in
**Guided & Wireless EM Transfer** felt okay. I did the latter one yesterday
and it was definitely quite hard, but I think I did well enough for a pass.
It's been a bit hectic since I arrived in Delft around 10 days ago, and I've
spent the absolute majority of the time studying for the exams.
I noticed that I hadn't followed the course material as well as I usually do,
so I felt like there were a lot of gaps of knowledge that I had to fill, in
order to feel good about the exams. Since there's no shortcuts for this,
the only solution for me was to put in many hours, and so I did!

I probably averaged about 10-12 hours of studies the last week and it totally
paid off, however this is the first time that I've felt genuinely
stressed about an upcoming exam. I'm usually quite prepared even before the exam
period even starts, because I usually follow the course thoroughly,
but this time it was different. I have to say, that I prefer to spend more time
during the entire course, and build up (under more relaxed conditions) a deeper understanding
of the course material, and then do the exams. So in other words, I won't do it
this way in the future. However when looking back at why this happened,
I must say that taking some time off from hard studies in November/December was
very well needed for me, and nothing that I regret.

Enough rambling, exams in Delft are (hopefully) **over!**

While the past 10 days have been filled with plenty of studying, I've also
ensured that I enjoyed the last of Delft and took some time to reflect on
the past 5 months. Unfortunately all restaurants and bars were closed due
to covid, but I bought a mocha from one of my favorite cafe's, and then
took a nice walk around the city of Delft while enjoying the view of the
canals, the old buildings, the narrow streets and my awesome hot beverage.

I really liked Delft as a city, and while I come from a slightly bigger city
myself, I really appreciated the "coziness" that the city gives, and the fact
that it contains tons of good restaurants and bars. Further, there are barely any
cars inside the city which makes it quite relaxing and nice to walk around in.
However, you can't relax too much, because there's bike's everywhere,
and I literally mean everywhere!

Due to flight ticket prices as well as wanting to get home, I had booked flight
tickets already the day after the last exam, so the "only" celebration that took
place was a few beers, some old port wine and a bunch of cookies/snacks that
I otherwise had to throw away ðŸ˜ƒ. So I had to pack my stuff, put everything
in the apartment in the way it was when I arrived and leave without too much
time for vacation. As a result, I'm currently sitting on the train, on the
final way to my home city in Sweden. The flight went well and within about
an hour I will be home again.

So, while this does officially mark an end to my exchange studies at TU Delft,
I will make at least one more post where I will do a proper reflection on the
exchange. For this, I'll first need some time to reflect!

As usual, I'll end the post with some photos, this time; all taken from my
last walk in the city.
