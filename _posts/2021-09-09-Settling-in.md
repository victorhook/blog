Hey! It's been two weeks now since I arrived in Delft and I think I'm starting
to settle a bit. Last Friday, me and some of the exchange students went out again to
have a few beers, and we had a good time! I then spent the majority of the weekend
exploring the city as well as studying. I have also gotten myself a bike,
which is somewhat of a requirement here. I rent it through [Swapfiets](https://swapfiets.nl/en-NL)
which is very handy.

4 out of 5 courses have now started so school is almost up
and running on full speed. The newest course that started this week is
Machine Learning for Robotics, which I mentioned in my last post.
This course seems to take quite a practical approach to Machine Learning with the
focus on learning how to apply it to projects (especially robotics) without digging
too deep into the underlying algorithms and mathematics. It is a Masters' course
so most of the other students are master students in robotics, so it's going to
be very interesting to discuss with others about solutions etc.
We will have weekly practicum assignments where we work in pairs, so I will work
with a Belgian guy that has a bachelor's in Aerospace Engineering. I'm really
looking forward to this course. ðŸ“–

### Story time!
During the summers of 2019 and 2020 I worked as an intern at [bitcraze](https://www.bitcraze.io/),
which is a company in MalmÃ¶, Sweden, that sells pocket-sized drones which has
autopilot and a bunch of other cool features. One of my colleagues there had
just finished her studies at TU Delft, so when I knew that I was going here, I
sent her a message asking about some tips etc. One cool thing that she responded
with was a question if I wanted to join a lab. I didn't really knew what she meant
by that, but was very much interested! Anyways, she gave me a contact from her
old supervisor, who is working at [mavlab](https://tudelftroboticsinstitute.nl/labs/mavlab)
(mav = Micro Air Vehicle) and I sent him a few messages asking if there was anything
I could do to help them out. Long story short, I met with him last week, and we agreed
that I will try to help two PhD students with one of the project they're working on.
Just check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEhu-FePBC0)
to get a glimpse of what they're doing in this lab, it seems truly amazing!

I've also attended the Digital Photography course this week
and it was quite fun! We were 10 students and 1 teacher.
During the first lecture he discussed some of the basics and fundamentals of digital photography
and we also took some experimental photos. The **number 1** rule from now on
is to have everything on **manual**. I've had most settings on manual so far
so it's not that foreign to me, but I haven't experimented with light settings yet
so that will be new.
My main objective with this course
is to learn more about photography (duh!), both on the techincal aspect as well
as creativity and I generally want to become more comfortable with my camera and with taking photos. I haven't taken many
photos on people so maybe that can be something that I will try to explore.
We will get assignments for each week and for the first week we got:
1. Shoot a few photos with *shutter speed* set to 4s and the *aperture* to the lowest value.
If you don't know what those words means, then hold on, I will probably explain them
in some future posts! ðŸ˜Ž
2. Find three pictures that I really like.
This is going to be very fun and I actually don't know which pictures that I
will pick, so we'll see!

So everything is pretty much up and running. Tomorrow (Friday 10/9), the last
course will start, [Electronic Circuits](https://studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=57844).
I'm not entirely sure how this course will differ from Circuit Analysis but I
guess I will find out tomorrow!

One last thing, tomorrow I will also get my keys to the apartment that I
will sublease for the remainder of my stay here (So far I've lived in a house
with a shared bathroom, kitchen etc). So my plan is to move in on Saturday,
which I'm very much looking forward to! ðŸ˜Ž
