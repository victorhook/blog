It's been a few weeks since my last post. I've had a really nice and relaxing
holiday and I actually took over a week completely off from my studies. I spent the
Christmas in Skåne (Sweden), together with my girlfriend and my family, and then me
and my girlfriend travelled north to celebrate New Year's in Falun (Sweden).
Then we went to Stockholm and that's where I've been the last two weeks.
It's been very chill weeks and I've only studied for a few hours a day, and then
either relaxed or worked on some project.

Now it's time to get back to work (studies) though, and as of writing this, I'm sitting on
Stockholm airport, waiting to board my flight back to Amsterdam, where I'll take
the train to Delft. It's exactly 1 week until my first exam in **Advanced
Electronics for Robotics**, and 10 days until the second exam; in **Guided &
Wireless EM Transfer**. My study-prep feels OK, but I definitely need to put
in some hours this week to ensure that it feels good during the exams!

Once the exams are over I leave Delft on Friday the 28th of January (end of exchange) and this time
it will probably take bit longer than 4 weeks until I get back! I will for sure
do a proper reflection once the exchange is over, because there's so many things
for me that takes some time to digest and really appreciate/think over.

As usual, I'll end the post with some photos. We actually got a white Christmas in Skåne, which is not
very common, but it was sure beautiful!
