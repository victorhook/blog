Hey!
Weeks are flying by and Christmas is coming up in less than two weeks.
I believe this is always a very cosy time and I really do love Christmas
and the time close to it. Delft has decorated the city with some nice lighting
which makes the city even more cosy than usual. The weather here is still not
too cold, around 5 degrees, mostly rain and some wind, but every once in a while
the sun comes out which is a nice suprise! ðŸŒžðŸ˜†
Back home in Sweden they have plenty of snow, so we'll see if it stays until I go home!

I go home for Christmas on the 21st of December, and haven't decided for how
long I will stay. I have exams on 24th and 27th of January and as far as I
understand it, nothing in between, so it will be a long Christmas break!
The two exams are for the courses *Advanced Electronics for Robotics*, and
*Guided and Wireless EM Transfer*, which I'm taking at the moment.
The schedule here in Delft doesn't completely match the schedule of my home
university, because the courses that I will take after the exchange starts
already on the 19th of January, so I will probably miss the first two weeks
of studies for those courses. Oh well, what can you do? ðŸ¤”

It's been almost 4 months since I first left Sweden and arrived here in Delft,
and I think it's going to be very nice to come home again. I will do a proper
reflection once the exchange is over, but for now I can say that it's going to
be super nice to come home a bit for Christmas.

Not much else has happened really, the
covid restrictions here in the Nederlands got significantly worse, so everything
except supermarkets closes at 5pm. I also had a cold for about 2 weeks so I've
spent most of my time resting, studying or working on my drone.

So soon it's time for Christmas and time for a break from studies and Delft,
until then, I hope you have a nice Christmas preparation time! ðŸŽ…
