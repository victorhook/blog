I've now done 4 of 5 exams and I will do the last one today! So far it's been going
well and I feel happy with how I've performed. I know I will not ace any of them,
but like I've said before, that's not my goal.

Here's a quick overview of what exams I've taken and how they felt:

- **Circuit Analysis** - 3 hours, open-book, 6-8 questions (can't remember exactly).
This one felt pretty good and didn't bring too many surprises. There were a few
theory questions that I wasn't too sure of, but the calculations went well (I think).
- **Electronic Circuits** - 3 hours, multiple-choice, open-book, open-notes &
everything except internet connection, 30 questions. It was divided into two parts, and the first
one felt OK, and the second one felt good. Since it was multiple-choice, there were
quite a few trick questions, and the fact that the exam was between 18:30-21:30,
definitely had an impact on how I performed. Overall, it felt pretty OK.
- **Machine Learning for Robotics** - 2 Hours, closed-book, 8 questions. This
one was quite stressful and the time was not really enough. The professors were aware
of this though so they said that they would take this into consideration while
grading. Why not reduce the questions or increase the time? No idea honestly... üòÜ
Overall it went well, mostly discussions and fact questions, so barely any calculations.
- **Digital Communication Systems** - 3 hours, closed-book, 1 A4 hand-written notes allowed,
6 questions. This was the exam I was dreading the most and therefore the one I've
prepared for the most. The preparation absolutely paid off and I felt like it went
pretty good. It was not really enough time here either, so I didn't have time to
double-check everything as I'd liked, so I know I made some mistakes here and there.
I really hope (and think) that it was enough, because I really don't want to re-do this one!

So if you're interested in Digital Communcation Systems, here's the main content of the course on 1 A4 üòÉ.
As a sidenote, I barely used the notes, only for a few equations, but in general,
I already knew most of the things there by heart at this point. I believe this is
the reason why the professor allows hand-written notes."%}

So overall it has been going well and I'm happy with my performance. Now there's
only 1 exam left (for this quarter), which is in **Signal Processing**. I'll write this one in a few hours
and then my girlfriend is coming to visit me again! I've been looking forward to
this for a long time and it's going to be so nice to take a break from school and studies
and just enjoy life for a few days.

All 5 courses I've taken end after this quarter and in the next quarter (Q2),
I have 3 new ones coming up. They start already next week, Monday, 8th of November.
The courses are:
- **Advanced Electronics for Robotics**
- **Guided and Wireless EM Transfer**
- **Marsrover Project**

As I've written before, the last one is definitely the one I'm looking forward to
the most and it's going to be super exciting to see what it offers! But, this will
have to wait until next week, after todays' exam it's time to relax! üòéüçπ

As usual, I'll end the post with some photos that I've taken üì∑
