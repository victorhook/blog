Hey!
Another week has passed and I'm starting to feel more and more settled.
Last Saturday me and a few international students went to Rotterdam to explore
the city a bit. We first took a harbour tour by boat and then cycled and walked around.
We had food at [Markthal](https://www.markthal.nl/), which is a big food court where
they had tons of different snacks and foods. There I bought my first **fresh** stroopwafel üç™
which was awesome! We also hade some beer and a really nice pizza later in the
night. Overall I had a very good time!

This week's photography task was to shoot portraits in black and white.
I haven't taken any photos of persons but I think portratis of items is just
as fine. The key was to play around with the **aperture** setting on the
camera, which essentially is how *wide* the lense is.

The *higher* the aperture number is,
the more *closed* the lense is, and the *bigger* depth of focus we get. The inverse
of this is that if I choose a *low* aperture value, the lense is *wide open*, and
the depth of focus is very *tiny*. Also, as you might have guessed, the smaller aperture,
the more light is hitting the lense (sence it's more open). This means that we can
shoot photos with a higher shutter speed, so we can "*freeze*" the image, and shoot
moving objects without blur effects.
Here are two examples using different aperture values.

{% include image.html url="delft_15_aperture_high.jpg" description="High aperture, notice the big depth of focus."%}

The images above were taken from exactly the same place, with the only difference being
the aperture setting, to alter the depth of field.

Here are some other photos that I took during the week:

The course **Signal Processing** is becoming very interesting and last week I made
a program that can detect what frequencies there is in an audio signal. This can
be useful if you for instance, want to make a guitar tuner, where you need to
know the exact frequencies in the signal. So, from an audio signal, we can with
the help of the **Fourier Transform** see what frequencies are present in that particular
audio signal. Exactly how this work I will explain in a future post
completely deticated to this topic. üòÉ

Last weeks practicum for **Machine Learning for Robotics** was also quite fun, the aim was:
We want to build a robot that can pick up pens. The robot has a camera to
"see" the world, and an arm to pick up the pen. The task in the lab was to make
the robot detect where the tip and the end of the pen was, with the help of
Machine Learning.

So what we had to do:
- We *collect* a bunch of images of pens.
- We *annotate* the images, marking where the tip and ends of the pen really are.
- We *train* a model with the images, and the annotation
- We *evaluate* the model to see how well it performs.

This is quite a summarized explanation of it, without going too deep into any
of the details. In the end, we had a model that could predict where the tip
and the end of a pen was, given only an image as input. While this is not
really useful on its own, I think it was a very informative and I believe that
many of the steps we did, can be used in other projects as well.

I'll end the post with this image üòç
