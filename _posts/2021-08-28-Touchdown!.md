The adventure finally begins!
At 08:15 26th of August 2021, I flew from Copenhagen to Amsterdam and then took the train to Delft.
Everything went well and I arrived in Delft around 12:00.
From the train station, it's a 20 minute walk to my first accommodation where I will
spend 18 nights. This place is a typical dutch (I think!) house and I share
kitchen and bathroom with a few other people.

Ever since I moved from home (6 years ago now?) I have lived in my own
apartment and I'm very fond of my privacy. Because of this I knew that
sharing kitchen and bathroom with strangers that I dont know, in a foreign country,
will become a challenge and a new experience for me. Hopefully this will work out
better than I expect! üòÉ

I spent the rest of the day checking out campus, walking around in the City
and tried to grasp that I was actually in Delft. I have been planning this trip
for such a long time that it felt quite surreal to actually be here.
I have now left everything that I know, the people that I love and places where I feel safe,
to explore this new city and begin an interesting adventure.
This is both a terrifying and exciting feeling and I know that it's new experiences
like this that makes me grow the most as a person. So, a part from (hopefully)
getting high quality education, I am really looking forward to pushing my personal
limits and evolving as a person during this exchange.

On the second day, Friday 27/8, we had an introduction for all exchange students
of my faculty EEMCS (Electerical Engineering, Mathematics & Computer Science).
We were about 40-50 students from all over Europe and it
was nice to chat with some other students. The introduction included some general
information about the faculty, course registration and the a tour around the faculty building. In the afternoon we got to hang out and chat some more, have a burger and a few beers. I had a [beer](https://delftsebrouwers.nl/bieren/tripel) from a brewery in Deft which was quite Ok! üç∫.

The courses officially starts on Monday 30/8 and first we'll have an introduction
for the minor and then the first lecture is in Circuit Analysis. I think it's
going to be very fun to start the courses and get back to studying, it's been
quite some time now!

I'll end of the post with some photos that I took during my walk in the city
