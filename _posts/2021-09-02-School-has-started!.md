It's been a whole week now since I first arrived in Delft and quite a lot
has happened. ðŸ˜ƒ Firstly, during the weekend last week, me and
a few other exchange students went out to eat at a recommended restaurant
[WijnHaven](https://www.wijnhaven.nl/). There, I had my first vegan dÃ¶nerkebab
(no I'm not kidding!) which was really good actually! We also grabbed some beers
in the city center before heading home.

During the remainder of the weekend I explored the campus a bit more and spent some time studying
and preparing for the coming week in the schools library (which is a really cool building!).
I always like to be prepared before the courses actually start so this was a
good time to get an overview of what the courses will be about and I
also started digging into some of the materials. I ended the
weekend feeling prepared and very excited for official start of the semester!

On Monday 30/8 my courses officially started, and first we hade an introduction
for the [Minor](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/studeren/minoren/electronics-for-robotics)
which gave an overview of the courses and roughly what we will learn. We were
also told that the education will be a hybrid combination of on-campus lectures as well
as online (the majority will probably be online). I got a pretty good feeling
from this introduction and once it was over we had our first lecture in
[Circuit Analysis](http://microelectronics.tudelft.nl/eee/Education/coursedetail.php?mi=61).
This lecture started with an introduction before diving into some of the material
and we were told that it was mostly going to be online and based on self-study
material with pre-recorded videos from previous years. This was a shame in my
opinion, but luckily I have already taken a similar course at my home University
so I should know most of the topics already. However, I have a hard time to get
a genuine understanding of certain parts of electronics and circuit analysis, so some repetition
is always very nice!

On the following day we had our first lectures in [Digital Communication Systems](https://cas.tudelft.nl/Education/coursedetail.php?mi=122)
as well as [Signal Processing](https://studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=57336),
which (the latter) is definitely my favorite course so far!
In this course we will explore an area in technology/math that I wish I knew last year.
The reason for this is that I was building an [app](https://github.com/victorhook/GuitarTunerX2000) that was suppose to be a guitar-tuner.
So basically; You make any kind of sound and the app displays what frequency it is (in Hz)
and how far away from a "normal" guitar tune it was.
The problem that I faced was:

*How do I know what frequency the input audio signal is?*

**Answer**: Signal Processing to the rescue! With the help of DSP (Digital Signal Processing)
we can actually retrieve what frequency(ies) the input audio signal consists of.
I kind of knew that last year while I was developing the app, but I didn't have the energy nor time to learn how to perfom this
calculation as it seemed quite daunting when I tried to dig into some of the math.
So I had to end up using a library that performed all the calculations for me and
I just used it as a blackbox (which I hate!).
So I think my point with the story is that I have a very good use-case for actually
learning this stuff and I can't wait to make my **own** guitar-tuner! ðŸ˜Ž

I've also decided to take an additional course as extra:
[Machine Learning for Robotics](https://studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=59491),
which I also think will be super interesting and give me a decent knowledge
and some practical experience in machine learning. As a computer scientist I kind of
have to know AI & machine learning at some point, so I might as well get on with it!
I also think that knowledge from this course can benefit me in the **Mars Rover Project**!


So, during the first half of this semester (for the remaining ~8 weeks)
I will take the following courses:
- Circuit Analysis
- Electronic Circuits
- Digital Communication Systems
- Signal Processing
- Machine Learning for Robotics

Last but not least, I've also signed up for a Digital Photography course, where
I will (hopefully) learn the fundamentals of digital photography, like camera settings,
lighting etc. While I know some of this stuff at a really basic level already,
I consider myself as a complete amateur when it comes to photography and I look forward
to getting a better and deeper understanding of it. The course is offered through
[Tu Delft X](https://www.tudelft.nl/x) which is really awesome, and this gives me
a great reason to take more photos and a next step in photography! ðŸ“¸

I'll end the post with a photo that I took during a walk.
