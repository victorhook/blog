Another week has passed and everything is running on full speed. I'm doing my best
to balance the 5 courses that I'm taking but it's not always that easy. The overhead from
switching between different subjects is noticable and something that I *don't* like
about taking so many courses is that fact that I *can't* dwelve very deep into
any of the topics. If I did, I simply wouldn't have the time to understand the other
topics. Thus I end up knowing each topic pretty well, but not *"mastered"*,
which I might have liked. Because of this, I'm "only" taking 3 courses in the
next quarter, where I will try to focus more on getting a deeper understanding of
the topics, as well as having more free time and enjoying life. [I mentioned last week]({% post_url 2021-10-09-droneh_v0.1 %})
that I miss tinkering and that I've started a new project, *droneh* (DIY drone, from scratch). I've received
some of the parts for this, but I will have to wait until the exams are over to actually
do tinkering, right now I have to focus on school!

Exams are coming up in ~1.5 weeks so it's time to start preparing for this.
Usually, I start preparing for the exams even earlier, but we haven't covered
all material yet and actually have lectures almost up untill the day of exam.
I'm doing 5 exams, and the first two are in **Circuit Analysis**
and **Electronic Circuits**. While I have to practise quite a bit for these,
I feel good about doing them. I've taken a course in Circuit Analysis before so
most of the concepts are familar to me, but it's amazing how fast you forget things...
Especially details of how you calculate certain equations.

My goal is actually *not* to get max grade, but rather to *learn the material well* and pass
the exams. This is somewhat different from how I've done it at my home uni, where I aimed for top grade in all courses.
This relieves some of the stress for me which is nice, but honestly I think it's
a better and more resonable mindset.

I've started a tradition of going to a cafÃ© every Sunday, to get a nice cup of
coffee, get an environment change and do some studying. This has turned out to
be a supernice tradition and definitely something that I'll hold on to!

I'll end the post with some photos that I've taken. Next week is the last lecture
in my photography course. I'll do a reflection on the courses later but I can
say that I'm very happy that I took it and I've learned a lot from it! ðŸ˜ƒ
