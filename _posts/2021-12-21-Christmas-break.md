## It's finally time for Christmas break! ðŸŽ…

After months of hard work, good food and sad covid restrictions, it's finally
time for me to go home again. I haven't been home since I left back in august
so it feels really weird to actually leave Delft. Weird, but still realy good
though, I'm very excited to get home and looking forward to it!

I "ended" (still have 2 exams left in January) my studies with an exam yesterday,
that was about antennas. It was a bit stresful, but felt OK so I think it went
okay. I can definetely feel that I've put in less work than usual on studies during the
last quarter, which I think is because the first quarter was so intense. I don't
feel like I have to put in the crazy hours anymore, and instead enjoy that fact
and do some other random fun stuff instead. For instance, I've been putting many
hours into my [drone project]() which is making some nice progess. Most of the
time spent has been on software and trying to answer some of the following questions:
- How do you control a drone?
- How should the code be structured to make it logical, easy to understand
and extend in the future? Eg, how can I make sure that I can take a break from
the project for a month and then come back, without feeling like I have to re-do
everything again (this is very common for me unfortunately).
- How does attitude estimation work? (In other words; How does the drone know
what orientation it has?)
- How should the communication protocol between the drone and the controller & PC look?

These are just some of the questions and things I've been thinking about and
worked with, and I feel like it's starting to make some sense. There's already
several things I know I need to do differently for the next version of the drone,
and it feels quite nice to discover and learn some of this stuff in a very practical manner.

I'm also planning some other hardware projects for the future, and I think that I
want to invest some time into creating electronics circuits and on pcb design.
It's quite daunting in the beginning, but I feel that the more I learn about electronics,
the more confident I get, and the more cool stuff I can do. Something this exchange
has given me, is open doors to a deeper understanding in electronics. This is to me
quite valuable, even though I'm not neccesarly sure I want to work with it.

#### For the curious reader
You can divide electronics into *analog* electronics, and
*digital* electronics. The difference is that with analog, all components are
in essence quite dumb, and just act according to the laws of physics. There is
no software, no code, no 1s or 0s, just *analog* values everyqhere. This is the
part of electronics that I know the least and feels daunting at times. Especially
since many parts of it is incredibly complex and requires a lot of time and effort
to understand. The theory basically builds on pure physics.
On the other side we have digital electronics, which I feel more confident with.
This is where the continous values between -infinity to infinity turns into discrete
values, like 1's and 0's. This is where software comes in, where we can control
stuff with code instead of adjusting a potentiometer or something.

What I like, is the combination between these. I like when the digital and the
analog parts meet, and where they have to be combined in clever ways, which allows
you to create insanely cool stuff. For instance, my drone project combines multiple
analog components as well as digital ones. It's hard, it takes a lot of work, but
it's really cool! ðŸ˜Ž

Enough talking about technical details, it's time for a Christmas break, it's
time to relax, hang out with family and eat a bunch of good food. Like I mentioned
in the beginning, I have two exams in the end of January, so I'll have to get
back to Delft sometime before that. However, I'm not sure exactly when that will be.

As usual, I'll end the post with some photos, I hope you have a Merry Christmas,
and a happy New Year! ðŸŽ†
